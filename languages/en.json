As a result, since late 2007, as a freelancer, I've been dedicated to social media as a community manager and to digital marketing. At the same time, since 2021, I decided (once again) to adapt to the present and focus on programming, thus becoming a Python (Django) and web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) developer. My intention is to continue learning and acquiring knowledge to be able to work in this world that I discovered and find very exciting.",
