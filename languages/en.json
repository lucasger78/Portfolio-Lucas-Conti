I specialize in building custom websites that not only look good but also communicate clearly and are ready to scale.\nI come from the creative world: over 15 years in advertising, copywriting, and digital marketing. That gave me an integral vision I now apply to development: I see websites as platforms for communication and strategy, not just simple pages.\nI work independently with companies of all sizes looking to make the digital leap, and I especially enjoy when the process is collaborative.\nI'm always open to challenging projects and also to joining visionary teams where I can contribute both technically and creatively.",
